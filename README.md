# DDU Meet Links

A tool to help keep track of which google meet link to join in on a day in the week. We had a common google meet link for all days for the main lectures and extra links for labs. So I made this tool to help me join the google meet without any hassle. (COVID-19 made me do this, if not for it I'd have had in-person lectures)
